Install any modpack from CurseForge on linux easily

<h1>How to use</h1>

<p>Open a terminal and paste these commands:</p>
<p>cd Downloads</p>
<p>git clone https://github.com/CustomCheat/LinuxCurse.git</p>
<p>cd LinuxCurse</p>
<p>pip install -r requirements.txt</p>
<p>python3 main.py</p>
<p>Then u just enter the name of the modpack and it will start! Keep an eye on the terminal if there is an error please report it to the Issues tab on github (of course only if the error is not something like Invalid choice only if it is a error that has to do with the code)</p>
<p>If u want to use the modpack later use launcher.py</p>
<p>Looking forward to do this in a GUI contact me if u want to help</p>
