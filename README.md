# LinuxCurse
Install any modpack from CurseForge on linux easily.
This is not a official way to install modpacks in any way!
Btw this is what i call a "dev build", that means it doesn't have any fancy things, but it works, well that's the main thing right?
<h2>DO NOT USE THIS THE NEW API DOESNT WORK WITH THIS INSTEAD USE THIS: https://github.com/North-West-Wind/CurseForge-CLI/ </h2>
<h1>How to use</h1>
<p>U have to install the minecraft-launcher package for unofficial launchers continue reading</p>
<p>Open a terminal and paste these commands:</p>
<p>cd Downloads</p>
<p>git clone https://github.com/CustomCheat/LinuxCurse.git</p>
<p>cd LinuxCurse</p>
<p>pip install -r requirements.txt</p>
<p>python3 main.py</p>
<p>Then u just enter the name of the modpack and it will start! Keep an eye on the terminal if there is an error please report it to the Issues tab on github (of course only if the error is not something like Invalid choice only if it is a error that has to do with the code)</p>
<p>After the downloading finishes forge installer will appear just click ok</p>
<p>After forge is installed Minecraft launcher will start (make sure u have the minecraft-launcher package) log in and create a new profile and select forge then just hit play!</p>
<p>If u want to use the modpack later use launcher.py</p>
<p>Bewere that this comes with no guarantees and some modpacks may not work some forge versions have a specific file name and dont get coppied etc.</p>
<p>Btw english isn't my first language so sorry for any mistakes if u found one contact me at discord</p>

<h1>For filthy pirates</h1>
<h3>It is not recommended to use this with an unofficial launcher this is designed for the official launcher!!</h3> <p>This can be used with launchers like tlauncher but only with modification or when it tries to open minecraft-launcher just exit the program go into tlauncher and select the work directory in settings as the .minecraft folder in the LinuxCurse/{modpack} folder (.minecraft Files may not appear u can change this in the file manager settings or use Google...) Select forge and start.</p>


<h1>Todo:</h1>
<p>This is a list what i would want to do with this repository(probably not gonna do these things because CurseForge said there will be support for linux in like 1-2 years, but it isn't clear what will be with CurseForge for linux)</p>
<p>For future i want to do this in a GUI contact me if u want to help me with the project (Done basicly the repository CurseForgeGUI speaks for itself)</p>
<p>Make the forge installer silent (could not do that because there is so much versions of the forge installer) (kinda fixed with new CurseForgeGUI)</p>
<p>Add a mods manager (In development in the CurseForgeGUI repository)</p>
<p>Tool for creating your own modpacks (it's kinda like the above one)</p>
