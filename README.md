# LinuxCurse
Install any modpack from CurseForge on linux easily

<h1>How to use</h1>

<p>Open a terminal and paste these commands:</p>
<p>cd Downloads</p>
<p>git clone https://github.com/CustomCheat/LinuxCurse.git</p>
<p>cd LinuxCurse</p>
<p>pip install -r requirements.txt</p>
<p>python3 main.py</p>
<p>Then u just enter the name of the modpack and it will start! Keep an eye on the terminal if there is an error please report it to the Issues tab on github (of course only if the error is not something like Invalid choice only if it is a error that has to do with the code)</p>
<p>If u want to use the modpack later use launcher.py</p>

<h1>Todo:</h1>
<p>This is a list what i would want to do with this (probably not gonna do these things because CurseForge said there will be support for linux in like 1-2 years)</p>
<p>For future i want to do this in a GUI contact me if u want to help me with the project</p>
<p>Make the forge installer silent (could not do that because there is so much versions of the forge installer)</p>
<p>Add a mods manager</p>
<p>Tool for creating your own modpacks (it's kinda like the above one)</p>
